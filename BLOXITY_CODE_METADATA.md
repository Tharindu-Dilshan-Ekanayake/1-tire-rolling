# +1 Tire Rolling: Boxity integration

The player cannot die: there is no death or game-over screen. You train Health, roll
your tire down the track as far as your Health takes it, and the tire always comes back.

## Leaderboards

Scores are reported by the **game server**, never by the client
(`server/src/bloxityLeaderboards.js`, `BLOXITY_LEADERBOARDS`). Every ~20 s and when a
player leaves, each pod sends the changed scores of its verified players to
`POST {api}/v1/leaderboards/hosted/{BLOXITY_GAME_ID}/report` as `legion_<userId>`.

| Board      | Label            | Score                                | Format  |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| `rebirths` | Rebirths         | `profile.rebirths`                   | number  |
| `wins`     | Total Wins       | `profile.stats.totalWins`            | compact |
| `distance` | Longest Roll (m) | `floor(profile.stats.bestDistance)`  | compact |
| `playtime` | Minutes Played   | `floor(profile.stats.playtime / 60)` | number  |

All four are `order: desc`, `mode: best`, `reset: none`.

## Gems purchases

Boxity's purchase webhook goes to `POST /api/gems/webhook` on the game server. It is
recorded in the database by `transactionId` (idempotent) and applied exactly once by
the pod the buyer plays on. Unknown skus are answered 400 so Boxity refunds them.

## Rewarded ads

The client sends `adReward { placement, rewardToken }`; the server verifies the token
with `POST {api}/v1/ads/reward/verify` before granting anything.

## Open Rooms

Each pod reports its rooms every 2 s to `POST {MATCHMAKER_REPORT_URL}/{BLOXITY_GAME_ID}/rooms`
(`server/src/legionRoomReporter.js`, installed after `listen()`), so they show under
"Open Rooms" on the game page. The client joins `?roomId=` at launch and falls back to
normal matchmaking if that room is gone or full.

## Avatars

`client/src/game/PlayerAvatar.jsx` + `avatarRig.js` draw every slot: skin (with face,
shirt and pants), body parts, hat + hair + mask on `Neck1`, back on `Spine2`, neck/chest
on `Spine2` and waist on `Spine1` (rest-inverse placement), hands and shoes as mirrored
pairs following the leaf bones' position and rotation only. A player wearing an uploaded
character (`characterId`) gets its GLB via `avatar.getCharacter()` / `getCharacterFor()`,
with accessories fitted by `characterAccessoryMatrix`; on any failure the regular avatar
shows. Body proportions are applied by moving bones, so accessories follow them.

## Server environment

| Variable                | Purpose                                                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BLOXITY_REPORT_TOKEN`  | Token for leaderboard and room reports (none set = no reports) |
| `MATCHMAKER_REPORT_URL` | Where the Open Rooms reporter posts (injected by Boxity hosting) |
| `BLOXITY_GAME_ID`       | Hosted game id for reports (default `1-tire-rolling`)         |
| `LEGION_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Must match the webhook's `x-legion-webhook-secret` header     |
| `MONGODB_URI`           | Shared database for profiles and Gems grants (SQLite without) |
| `BLOXITY_API_URL` etc.  | Platform URLs; production defaults (`server/src/bloxityEnv.js`) |

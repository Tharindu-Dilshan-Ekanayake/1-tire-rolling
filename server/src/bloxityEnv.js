 * - BLOXITY_API_URL         the platform API (auth, leaderboards, ads)
 * - BLOXITY_MATCHMAKER_URL  the play host; game frontends live on <game>.<its host>
 * - BLOXITY_PORTAL_URL      the website
 * - BLOXITY_STATIC_URL      static files
 *
 * The production defaults below apply only to a variable that is missing; an injected
